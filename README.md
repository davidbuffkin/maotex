# maotex

Tools and templates for writing Mu Alpha Theta tests in LaTeX

But currently just a .tex format for tests and solutions (see format.tex)


Future plans include creating a unified file format for <question, answers, answer, solution> and using python to convert between content/tex/test/solutions
